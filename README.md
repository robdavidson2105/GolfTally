Golf Score Card for Pebble
Keeps a tally of your round of golf and calculates net score and Stableford points for the round.
When paired with a phone during a round - it uses the GPS to calculate distances to the pin for the current hole.
All the hole details are in a Parse database - which can be edited through http://golf-db.droppages.com/

Was built as a way to learn how to code on the Pebble.
